# Netgear Router Firmwares

The source code for Netgear router firmwares can be obtained by extracting it from https://kb.netgear.com/2649/NETGEAR-Open-Source-Code-for-Programmers-GPL. It is important to ensure that each file maintains its individual copyright.

Rather than packaging all files into a single large .zip file, each firmware version is now identified with a distinct tag. For instance, the tag `r7800-1.0.2.92` corresponds to `R7800` router firmware version `1.0.2.92`.
